    "In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through \"ABACA\", the value of the path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph with n nodes and m directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return null.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The i-th character represents the uppercase letter of the i-th node. Each tuple in the edge list (i, j) means there is a directed edge from the i-th node to the j-th node. Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.\n",

    " (0, 2),  \n",
    " (2, 3),  \n",
