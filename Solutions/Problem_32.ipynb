    "Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.\n",

    "- For a given cycle, we can compute how much more money we got while going around once. If and only if we find a cycle where that number is greater that 1, there is a possible arbitrage.\n",
    "- This is true because if we take a sequence A-B-...-A that makes us win money, we can look at all the sequence inside of this sequence of the type L-...-L without repetition of a letter. We then erase all the sequences that makes us lose money (we might have to do that multiple times). At some point, we'll encounter a sequence that makes us win money without repetition, this sequence is of length < n and as a result is a cycle.\n",
    "- To solve this problem, we'll use the following solution. We'll check for every starting currency (except the last one) if there is a \"winning cycle\" including that currency. To do that, we'll compute the amount of every currency we can get starting from a given currency in at most n steps. \n",
    "- We'll assume that at the index i, j of the array is the exchange rate to go from currency i to currency j"
